Requirements


Suppose the program ClientIPv4_win_2021.exe is running on each team’s workstation under
Windows 10, with IPv4 protocol enabled. Create a client/server program, using C language under
Linux CentOS which implements the following tasks: 

a) Stream socket-based communication in IPv4 with the program ClientIPv4_win_2021.exe. Linux
server will wait the clients requests at port 22513.The IPv4 client should connect to all assigned addresses of the IPv4
server. 

b) Processing of the command “13#” obtained from the program
ClientIPv4_win_2021.exe. The IPv6 client should connect to URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
of the HTTP IPv6 server: ipv6-test.com 

c)In case the received command is not recognized by the Linux server, a message “Command not
implemented” will be sent back to the Windows-based IPv4 client. After the IPv6 stream socket
connection has been established, the Linux-based IPv6 client will send the command
GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n to program HTTP IPv6 Server. 

d) Processing the answer from HTTP IPv6 Server (generic name, could be in reality an apache server
for instance), forwarding it towards the program ClientIPv4_win_2021.exe but also storing it as .html
file into the home directory.
